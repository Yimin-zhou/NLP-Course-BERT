      "\"to answer the first question on everyone s mind, yes. this newly redesigned psp case will fit your psp game console even if you have the mah battery with extended back plate. there is designated cutout in the rubber that allows the psp to rest perfectly in place with or without the extended battery cover.now the explanation for the one star rating the case itself looks a lot sleeker in the package and in pictures than envolped around the psp system itself. it has a cheap plasticy feel to it complete with a second rate, floating hinge that always seems as if its on the verge of breaking loose.also, unlike other psp cases i ve owned, the psp logo isn t etched or inscribed onto the case lid, even though it looks that way in pictures. the psp trademark on top is just a thin piece of printed cardboard placed underneath the clear shell.this case also comes complete with small rubber grips that, when opened properly, can be used to stand the case upright so you can view video files without holding the psp in your hands. only problem is the rubber grips never seem to hold onto whatever surface its standing on. it will slowly start to slide downward unitl it is laying flat on the table, the counter, the desk...etc..this case looks, feels and performs more like a . cheapo instead of a . quality product. for this price i would find something better and you can...very easily instead of settling for this lesser product.\"\n",
      "\"bloodborne is, without a doubt, one of the finest action role playing games ive ever had the pleasure of experiencing. from software has built upon their experience in this particular genre to create a fantastic lovecraft inspired horror fantasy world that few would forget once their journey is over. what began with s superb demons souls and continued with s dark souls and its sequel continues here in a more streamlined and action oriented fashion. the result is the playstation s first true killer app.it should go without saying that like its predecessors, bloodborne is not an easy game. the game still requires patience, skill, becoming familiar with the environments, and of course death. lots of it. you will see the words you died displayed on your screen more times than you can count. but each death is also a learning experience, and in the grand tradition of the souls games, dying is always entirely the fault of the player, not the game. this is because the game is meticulously balanced. it rewards strategy and smart combat, and is not very tolerant of being brash and careless. overcoming obstacles, opening up shortcuts, and defeating its wildly imaginative and grotesquely beautiful bosses will be some of the most rewarding moments you will experience.as far as souls games go, bloodborne has the richest story and supporting lore of the entire franchise. clues are hidden throughout the game which will slowly reveal the intricacies of the world. item descriptions contribute to this as well. you are a hunter, lost in the nightmare of a world taken over by a plague, overrun by its citizens become monsters. at the heart of the conflict, and world in general, is blood. therefore, the gore factor is up pretty high, but that only lends to its creepy atmosphere.unlike the prior souls games, bloodborne focuses on fast combat over the slower, methodical of the other games. shields and heavy armor are non existent here. on your right hand, you hold a trick weapon one that can be transformed into two forms . on your left hand, you have a firearm. fighting enemies and bosses is done by striking and dodging rather than blocking and parrying. several of the boss battles are designed with this in mind, and they are furiously intense as a result. also unlike the souls games, you have limited health items called blood vials. the game provides plenty on the way, and in keeping with its faster pace, the animation is quick and almost instant to keep you in the action. getting hit by an enemy reduces your health, but in a welcome twist, attacking the enemy shortly after getting hit will replenish part of your health. all this results in a much more accessible game overall. accessible, but still tough.aside from the main game, entire optional levels are also offered. these are called chalice dungeons, and contain some of the best loot in the game. once you obtain your first chalice, the player can proceed to explore these labyrinthine areas. they offer different gameplay from the main game. to me, its like the dungeons in a legend of zelda games, only darker and more difficult. the dungeons are a series of rooms, and for each one you must first find a switch that unlocks the door to the boss. then there are various treasure rooms where youll find materials needed to create and enter the next chalice dungeons. the chalice dungeons provide an enormous challenge, and are also a nice break from the main game, especially if you want to grind for blood echoes this games version of experience, or souls in earlier games .as with the other games, co op and pvp are also available. you may summon help at any time, or you can invade another players world and engage them in combat or be invaded yourself .from software and sony computer entertainment is treating bloodborne as a new ip. if this means that we can expect sequels, then i am certainly ready for more! bloodborne is one of the best games ive played and is currently the best game on ps. highly recommended!\"\n",

      "\"i ve used these headphones for a couple months now i probably should have written my review already, but i wanted to give them some real use before using them. i use them on windows vista , with a gaming laptop.i am amazed at the quality of the surround sound. first thing i did with them was to go to second life and watch a movie at the drive the theater there. and a motor scooter went past on my right side, from back to front. perfect sound location.i talked to some people with the mic. they all thought the sound was great.next i tried playing wow worlds of warcrsft . i always use the sound, and i was disappointed that i was getting no sound location. then i turned on the advanced sound. much better i could at least tell the approximate direction of an attack i could not see.wow has a problem every now and then when things get very busy, the sound is turned off by the game so that it has less to do. the game does it, the sound is turned off in the game options spontaneously, and you have to turn it on again. this happens just as often using the sound hardware and drivers in the headphone as it does the sound hardware and drivers built into my laptop, so my guess is that the headphone sound drivers don t slow the game down.vent works fine with the headphones. they show up as g mic and g headphonethe headphones provide a good level of isolation from the room sound. there are two issues. one is that they are heavy. after some hours, they become uncomfortable because of the weight. i suspect individual tolerance will vary, and if you play with your head supported like in a recliner you will be able to tolerate the weight better.they are about as comfortable as they can be for their weight and size with three interchangable head pieces to match your head shape, and the ability to extend the earpieces to fit even a very large head i wear a size hat, they fit me, and still have a click to go .the mic is designed to be pushed up and back, out of the way against the head strap. this is supposed to be so that you can have it out of your face when you are not using it, and it also mutes when pushed back it can be set to light up when it is muted . this allows you to brush it back and not be heard by others, and then move it forward and they can hear, assuming you are using voice activated game sound.after about six weeks of daily use, the mic started descending of its own weight. it is hinged where it attaches to the headset and when you push it up the mic just slowly descends over a few seconds. this means that the push the mic out of the way and it mutes function is essentially broken, since the mic is not staying back.i assume logitech would replace the phones if asked but i don t want to give them up.i gave the headphones stars despite the weight and despite the mic problem since i almost always want the mic where i can talk and i use a mouse button for push to talk. if these factors matter to you you might consider them in your decision.but i just do not know how you can hear something all out of one ear and still get a front back location out of headsets that are sealed. obviously the driver or headsets are doing something with phasing and repeating the sound from one headset to the other to make you have more than simple side to side location. this is really why i gave them stars. being able to do full d apparrent location positioning in a headset is just an amazing feat, well worth the rating.the windows installation was smooth.this is probably the absolute best headset gaming on the market. no one ever complains about my mic on vent anymore. the good seal around the ears means that there is never any feedback or echo. i can understand people if anyone can, and if i need to quickly adjust my level because someone is blasting or feeding back, the roller on the side of the headset works perfectly and is right there.but you really can t do top quality sound and isolation without mass. light headsets are always deficient in something the specs may be amazing but they just don t sound right to my ears. this headset sounds perfect. and these headsets take the issue of, we will not be deficient in sound in any way no compromise . i appreciate that but after hours or so they have to come off.finally, i will point out that they do not use your existing sound system in any way. they plug in using usb and windows sees them as a completely different set of sound hardware. in fact, if you are careful, you can set up so that say music comes out of your system speakers, using one player, and your game sound comes out of the headset. or if your sound is broken, or is lame, well, these take the digital stream and all the reproduction is done in the headset. this is actually a good thing, as long as you have a usb plug available.the usb cord is high quality. everything is top notch except for that silly hinge, and that is not important enough to me to get fixed.\"\n",

      "\"this controller is a very nice controller especially for the price i paid. this controller is intended to be a replacement for the nintendo wii s or wii u s classic controller or classic controller pro. it basically gives you a gamecube style button layout that plugs into the wii remote. this is not a replacement for a gamecube controller. it doesn t have the same connector that is used on regular gamecube controllers so if you intend to use this with a gamecube or plug it into a gamecube adapter for the wii u or the gamecube ports on some models of the nintendo wii it will not work for that purpose. the original nintendo classic controller is getting very hard to find so this is a good, cheap alternative to that controller. this controller is good for playing smash brothers on the wii or wii u systems as it plugs right into the wii remote and gives you the gamecube controller layout that seems to be the favorite for smash bros.the color on this one is shiny silver, which i really like. the back of it is black. it is a light controller and doesn t take batteries, rather it draws power from the wii remote instead. it does attach to the wii remote via a cord so that is something else to keep in mind.\"\n",

      "\"possibly the worst ps game i ve ever played. it doesn t start out bad though, it gets progressively worse as you play. the beginnig starts with promise, a cool setting, cool upgraded environments and some interesting new characters. but after the frst couple missions you realize the open world is extremely lifeless and linear. there s no identifiable change in scenery, you won t be able to tell one building from another and it all just feels boring and unpolished.runners vision they say that there s many paths to get to one place but that s not true. there s only one path with the occasional option to do a wall run or a slide, but overall, free roam or mission, there s always only one path. this is why you need to use runner s vision basically a gps system showing you where to go. but this is where i have one of the biggest complaints the runner s vision breaks the flow. the way it works is that it will occasionally highlight a bar or pipe that you will need to grab in red and every couple seconds a red shade with fly in front of you highlighting your path. but they aren t consistent. those red ledges only show up half the time and the red shade flies ahead of you and disappears. so, often times you will turn a corner and there s no indication on where to go but you don t want to lose your stamina so you run in a random direction but it turns out to be wrong and you end up wasting time and losing all stamina. i turned off the shade a couple times but then you will become completely lost because remember, there s only one path to the destination! how they botched up one of the essential elements for assisting free running is beyond logic physics? wtv another complaint is the story logic. as many people have complained about, the story here is boring and repetitive. i agree but would like to add that it doesn t even abide by logic. they just don t make any sense! why is there a bunch of people just standing on roof tops waiting for a runner to run by so they can ask for a delivery? and why are the receivers just seconds to a minute away chilling on another rood top, and if you don t get there in time even when you re so close that they call out runner, over here! , the package expires ? which contains things like flowers and letters also, the collectibles, why are there just yellow orbs all over the place? what the heck are they? what purpose do they carry? same goes for the micro chips that i m stealing from unprotected electrical boxes all over the city, what do they do? why am i stealing them from even my own headquarters? and also, after the cops or krugersec raids my headquarters and destroys it, why am i still able to use it as a safehouse? heck, why won t they just stand on all the roofs and wait for me since they know all the runners just dash around those same buildings? so many questions, so little logic.combatyou probably will have to see a video to understand how amazingly stupid combat is in this game. sense here, again, is abandoned. like how does a kick to the enemy s face takes a little health, but if he stumbles back a couple steps into a partner he loses half his healthbar? and how can i roundhouse an elite soldier and after he stumbles back steps throw a kick two meters away but still get me? combat is forced on you when you play and it definitely big the already wearysome experience.vertical runningalmost all the missions, especially the important ones, take place in some tall building. this means that instead of free running, you will be climbing. now i don t know about you, but i didn t buy this game for far cry style platforming. jumping from one block to another then rotating around for seconds finding the next pipe or ledge to grab to doesn t really feel like parkour, it feels like labor. but this is exactly what mec fives you. the last mission in particular does this so much that at one point, you will have a whole minutes of game time just grappling up from grapple point to grapple point like batman. this to me is just a sign that the team behind the game was tired of their project and wanted to finish up with filler.lipsynch and cutscenesthis is a minor complaint. i didn t mind the cutscenes so much because it was a chance to finally gives the characters more personality, and the graphics were actually pretty good. but lipsynch in most cutscenes are waaaay off, and the final cutscene where faith showdowns with...., that whole segment started to get choppy and buffer. the game really does get worse and it saved the worst for last.conclusionthis game actually reminds me of that cell shaded prince of persia game for the ps in the late s. story was completely pointless as the ending undermines all your achievements, combat was tiring and unsatisfying, landscape was drab and illogical, and parkouring consisted of trial and error due to poor wayfinding. boy, i disliked that game.ps. if you still insist on playing mec, play with faith in the elevator, there s usually a reflective black wall that can act as a mirror. you will see how awful she is rendered and for some reason you can see the back of her head when you turn quickly because apparently her eyes can turn around faster than her head.\"\n",

      "\"enchanted arms is an anime based, turn based rpg. now that this is out of the way let me briefly explain why i would not recommend this game to anyone today in . the game was released in . the graphics are very outdated if you care about such details. the intro movie is very cool but when you get into the gameplay itself the age really shows. the area during battle mode is divided into a grid where d characters stand in their battle stance waiting for your order. the interface is very similar to classic jrpg like final fantasy or phantasy star. the animations are very repetitive and do not have much variety in movement. the special effects for attack or defense spells and other weapons are ok. lots of nice flashing shapes and lights. you can move the camera into various positions plan out your attack paths or move very easily. what is especially nice is the quick mode or auto mode, one just does the battle choices for you, another avoids the steps that ask you to move.the problems arise when you are in the movement mode or outside the battle. let me give you an example. there is a class of students and in this particular scene all the male students are one to one copies of one another and the girls as well. it is annoying. when you move you can barely see any shadows anywhere. the npcs do not show much life either. if you were to see similar characters talk to each other, they have the same look with exception of haircuts or eye colors. when you run around you look like a robot and run with limited animations. when you face an obstacle your character keeps repeating the the running motion.english language voice overs are horrible with the exception of few characters. i cannot tell how bad or good the japanese voicing is.another strange or annoying thing, whatever you might call it, is the voice acting and presentation of one character who is suggested to be a crossdresser or homosexual. the issue i have with this is not that he is there but how he is presented. if you were to imagine any gay stereotype its in the character. think south park s big gay al there is a collar, face makeup, exposed stomach and girly gestures. just makes me think why.i would avoid this game at all costs. there are many better jrpgs for xbox out there. blue dragon is a great alternative.\"\n",
