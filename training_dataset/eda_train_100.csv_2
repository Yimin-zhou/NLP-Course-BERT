0,to answer the first question everyone s mind yes this newly redesigned psp case will fit your psp game console even if you have the mah battery with extended back plate there is designated cutout in the rubber that allows psp to rest perfectly in place or without the battery cover now the explanation for the one rating itself looks a lot sleeker in the package and in than envolped around the psp system itself it has a cheap plasticy feel to it complete second rate floating that always seems as if on the verge of breaking loose also unlike other psp cases ve owned the psp logo isn t or inscribed onto case lid even though it looks that way pictures the psp trademark on top is just thin piece of printed placed underneath the clear this case also comes complete small rubber that when opened properly can be used to stand the case upright so you can view video files without holding the psp in your hands only problem is the rubber grips never seem to hold onto whatever surface its standing on it will slowly start slide downward unitl it is laying flat on the table the counter the desk etc case looks feels and performs more a cheapo instead of a quality product price i would find something better and you can very easily for this product

1,bloodborne is without a doubt one of the finest action role playing games ive ever had the pleasure of experiencing from software has built upon their experience in this particular genre to create a fantastic lovecraft inspired horror fantasy world that few would forget once their journey is over what began with s superb demons souls and continued with s dark souls and its sequel continues here in a more streamlined and action oriented fashion the result is the playstation s first true killer app it should go without saying that like its predecessors bloodborne is not an easy game the game still requires patience skill becoming familiar with the environments and of course death lots of it you will see the words you died displayed on your screen more times than you can count but each death is also a learning experience and in the grand tradition of the souls games dying is always entirely the fault of the player not the game this is because the game is meticulously balanced it rewards strategy and smart combat and is not very tolerant of being brash and careless overcoming obstacles opening up shortcuts and defeating its wildly imaginative and grotesquely beautiful bosses will be some of the most rewarding moments you will experience as far as souls games go bloodborne has the richest story and supporting lore of the entire franchise clues are hidden throughout the game which will slowly reveal the intricacies of the world item descriptions contribute to this as well you are a hunter lost in the nightmare of a world taken over by a plague overrun by its citizens become monsters at the heart of the conflict and world in general is blood therefore the gore factor is up pretty high but that only lends to its creepy atmosphere unlike the prior souls games bloodborne focuses on fast combat over the slower methodical of the other games shields and heavy armor are non existent here on your right hand you hold a trick weapon one that can be transformed into two forms on your left hand you have a firearm fighting enemies and bosses is done by striking and dodging rather than blocking and parrying several of the boss battles are designed with this in mind and they are furiously intense as a result also unlike the souls games you have limited health items called blood vials the game provides plenty on the way and in keeping with its faster pace the animation is quick and almost instant to keep you in the action getting hit by an enemy reduces your health but in a welcome twist attacking the enemy shortly after getting hit will replenish part of your health all this results in a much more accessible game overall accessible but still tough aside from the main game entire optional levels are also offered these are called chalice dungeons and contain some of the best loot in the game once you obtain your first chalice the player can proceed to explore these labyrinthine areas they offer different gameplay from the main game to me its like the dungeons in a legend of zelda games only darker and more difficult the dungeons are a series of rooms and for each one you must first find a switch that unlocks the door to the boss then there are various treasure rooms where youll find materials needed to create and enter the next chalice dungeons the chalice dungeons provide an enormous challenge and are also a nice break from the main game especially if you want to grind for blood echoes this games version of experience or souls in earlier games as with the other games co op and pvp are also available you may summon help at any time or you can invade another players world and engage them in combat or be invaded yourself from software and sony computer entertainment is treating bloodborne as a new ip if this means that we can expect sequels then i am certainly ready for more bloodborne is one of the best games ive played and is currently the best game on ps highly recommended

1,of ve used these headphones for i couple ever now i probably should have them my review already but i wanted to good them some real in before using them i use different on windows vista with a to laptop i am amazed at the quality of the surround all first staying i did with them was to go to second life and watch a movie at the drive the is there and a motor hardware went past on my right i from back that front perfect sound absolute side talked to some people with by mic they all and the sound was great installation i three playing wow worlds of warcrsft i always use the sound and i was disappointed that i was getting need sound location then i turned on the advanced sound smooth better i could at least tell the approximate so of an attack i could not see wow is a problem every now and then when things get very deficient the sound is turned off by the game so that it has less to do the game does come the sound sound you off in the to options spontaneously and you have to turn it on i this happens just as often using the sound hardware and drivers in anyone headphone as it to the of hardware and drivers built into my slow so my guess is that the headphone sound drivers don t laptop the game down vent works fine with the headphones they show up as g mic and tolerate headphonethe the and a good level you isolation from the room sound you are two issues one is that or of heavy is some in they become is of of the weight i suspect individual tolerance will vary completely if turned play with your head supported like in a recliner because will be able it g the weight better they are i as comfortable as they can be they their weight and size with tried interchangable head of to match your the shape and the ability to extend the and game fit even a very large head talk wear mutes size hat for fit me and still have a click to go there mic is be direction be function up and but out thought the way against the head strap this is supposed to be to using you can have it out i your face when there are not using it and it also a when pushed back it can designed set in finally up when headphones is muted sound allows you if brush your back and not be heard it are to then move it forward and they can hear assuming you are using voice activated game sound after about six weeks of daily other the mic the descending of its own weight it is hinged where the attaches to the headset and when you push it up the mic just a descends over a few seconds this means that the push the mic out of the way and it mutes pushed after essentially broken since the mic theater not thing back i assume logitech would as head phones if asked but slowly don t want to give them up i gave the headphones stars despite the weight and despite the mic problem since again almost always want the mic where i don i my i use digital mouse button for push quality talk if sound say matter to you you might consider them in your decision but about just do not know how and can hear scooter all them of one ear earpieces still get a front back location in of headsets that are sealed obviously the driver these headsets others doing something with phasing and repeating the sound from one headset to the use to make you have more than simple side does side location this is really why i gave out stars being able to do full d apparrent location positioning to a headset is just an amazing feat well probably the rating the windows next was much this is worth the location best everything gaming on the market no one months complains about my mic on vent anymore the give seal around the ears means that there uncomfortable never any and or echo i can understand people if the can you if i no to quickly adjust my level because someone is is they feeding back the roller on the side of it headset works perfectly and is right the but you really can or do top can this and the without mass light headsets are always deficient out something isolation specs may be amazing back they just are t sound is to and ears this headset sounds perfect and these headsets take the issue pieces we will not be busy in sound use any way no compromise i appreciate that but after hours or so they have to to off light i will point out that they do not use it existing or system in any way they plug hours to usb provide windows sees written as get and them set of sound something in fact if you are careful you can set up so that factors music comes out of your system speakers using one player feedback your game sound comes out right the headset t gaming your sound is broken or is lame well these take started a stream and sound the reproduction is done in the headset this has actually a good thing as long replace you have a usb plug available the usb cord blasting high quality headset is top notch except for that silly hinge and important is not that enough to me to a fixed
1,i ve used these headphones for a couple months now i probably should have written my review already but i wanted to give them some real use before using them i use them on windows vista with a gaming laptop i am amazed at the quality of the surround sound first thing i did with them was to go to second life and watch a movie at the drive the theater there and a motor scooter went past on my right side from back to front perfect sound location i talked to some people with the mic they all thought the sound was great next i tried playing wow worlds of warcrsft i always use the sound and i was disappointed that i was getting no sound location then i turned on the advanced sound much better i could at least tell the approximate direction of an attack i could not see wow has a problem every now and then when things get very busy the sound is turned off by the game so that it has less to do the game does it the sound is turned off in the game options spontaneously and you have to turn it on again this happens just as often using the sound hardware and drivers in the headphone as it does the sound hardware and drivers built into my laptop so my guess is that the headphone sound drivers don t slow the game down vent works fine with the headphones they show up as g mic and g headphonethe headphones provide a good level of isolation from the room sound there are two issues one is that they are heavy after some hours they become uncomfortable because of the weight i suspect individual tolerance will vary and if you play with your head supported like in a recliner you will be able to tolerate the weight better they are about as comfortable as they can be for their weight and size with three interchangable head pieces to match your head shape and the ability to extend the earpieces to fit even a very large head i wear a size hat they fit me and still have a click to go the mic is designed to be pushed up and back out of the way against the head strap this is supposed to be so that you can have it out of your face when you are not using it and it also mutes when pushed back it can be set to light up when it is muted this allows you to brush it back and not be heard by others and then move it forward and they can hear assuming you are using voice activated game sound after about six weeks of daily use the mic started descending of its own weight it is hinged where it attaches to the headset and when you push it up the mic just slowly descends over a few seconds this means that the push the mic out of the way and it mutes function is essentially broken since the mic is not staying back i assume logitech would replace the phones if asked but i don t want to give them up i gave the headphones stars despite the weight and despite the mic problem since i almost always want the mic where i can talk and i use a mouse button for push to talk if these factors matter to you you might consider them in your decision but i just do not know how you can hear something all out of one ear and still get a front back location out of headsets that are sealed obviously the driver or headsets are doing something with phasing and repeating the sound from one headset to the other to make you have more than simple side to side location this is really why i gave them stars being able to do full d apparrent location positioning in a headset is just an amazing feat well worth the rating the windows installation was smooth this is probably the absolute best headset gaming on the market no one ever complains about my mic on vent anymore the good seal around the ears means that there is never any feedback or echo i can understand people if anyone can and if i need to quickly adjust my level because someone is blasting or feeding back the roller on the side of the headset works perfectly and is right there but you really can t do top quality sound and isolation without mass light headsets are always deficient in something the specs may be amazing but they just don t sound right to my ears this headset sounds perfect and these headsets take the issue of we will not be deficient in sound in any way no compromise i appreciate that but after hours or so they have to come off finally i will point out that they do not use your existing sound system in any way they plug in using usb and windows sees them as a completely different set of sound hardware in fact if you are careful you can set up so that say music comes out of your system speakers using one player and your game sound comes out of the headset or if your sound is broken or is lame well these take the digital stream and all the reproduction is done in the headset this is actually a good thing as long as you have a usb plug available the usb cord is high quality everything is top notch except for that silly hinge and that is not important enough to me to get fixed

0,possibly the worst ps game i ve ever played it doesn t start totally out bad though it gets progressively worse plow as you play the beginnig starts with angstrom promise front end a destroy cool setting cool upgraded environments stolon and some interesting new characters but after the frst couple missions you realize the open world is referable extremely lifeless boilersuit and linear there s no identifiable change in scenery you won t be able to tell one building from thither another and it all just of import feels boring and unpolished runners vision they say that there s many ho hum paths to get to one place but that s not yellow bellied true there s comprise only one path with the occasional option to do a wall run or a slide but overall free roam or mission there s always only one information technology path this is surprisingly why you need to use runner s vision basically a gps system angstrom showing you where boastful to go but this is where due south comprise i duad have one of the biggest complaints the runner s vision breaks the arsenic flow the way it endure along works is that it will occasionally highlight a bar or pipe that you will need to recognize grab in red and every livery couple seconds a red shade with fly in front of you highlighting your path but they aren t consistent those red ledges only show up half the time and the red shade flies ahead cover of you and disappears so often times subsequently you will turn a corner and organized religion there s no indication on gamy where to go but you don t want to lose your stamina comprise so you comprise run in a random direction but it angstrom turns out to be wrong and you end disembarrass up wasting time and losing all stamina write up i turned off the shade a couple times lone but then you will become completely lost because remember there s only one path to system of logic the destination how they botched up one of the induce essential elements for assisting free running is beyond logic physics wtv another complaint is the story logic as many people have complained about the story here is boring and repetitive i agree but would like to add that pensive it doesn able bodied t even abide by culture logic they just don t sami make rove any sense why is there a bunch of people just standing on roof tops waiting close to for a runner to run by so they can upwards ask for a delivery and why are the receivers just seconds to close to a room minute away rood tree endure chilling on another rood sense top and if you don t comprise get there in time even when you re so close that they call out runner over here the package expires which contains things like flowers and letters also the collectibles why are there just yellow orbs all over the place what the resolve heck are they what purpose do make they carry same goes for the micro chips turned that i m stealing from unprotected electrical boxes all over the city what do they do why am i stealing them from even my own headquarters and also after the cops or krugersec raids my headquarters and destroys it why am i still able to use it leave as a safehouse heck why won t they just stand on all the roofs and wait maraud for me since they know all the runners just dash around those same buildings so many questions so little logic combatyou probably will have to see a video to understand how amazingly stupid combat rapidly is in this game sense here again is abandoned like how does a kick to the enemy s face takes a little health but if he stumbles back a couple steps into totally a partner he make loses half his healthbar recognize and how can i roundhouse too an elite soldier and make after he stumbles back steps throw a kick two meters disappear away sang froid but still get me combat is forced on you when you play and it definitely big the already wearysome experience vertical runningalmost all gamy the missions especially the important ones make take place in some tall building this means that instead of free running you will be climbing now i don t know about you but i didn t buy ill use this game for far cry style platforming jumping gamy from due south one block to another then rotating around for seconds finding the next pipe or ledge to grab squad to doesn t really feel like parkour it feels like subsequently labor but this is exactly what mec fives thither you the last mission in particular does this so much that at one point you will have a charge whole minutes of game time fighting just grappling up from grapple point to grapple point like batman this to me is just a sign that the team behind the game was tired of their project and wanted to finish up with filler lipsynch and cutscenesthis is a minor complaint i didn t braggy mind the subsequently olive drab cutscenes so much because it astonishingly was a chance to finally gives the characters more personality and the graphics were actually pretty good but lipsynch in most cutscenes make are waaaay off and the final cutscene where faith showdowns with that whole wear segment started to get represent close to choppy and buffer the game gamy really does get address worse and it saved the worst make for last conclusionthis game actually reminds me of that cell shaded prince of persia game for the ps in the late s story was completely pointless as the ending thyroxine tincture undermines and so all your achievements combat was tiring and unsatisfying landscape was drab and illogical and parkouring consisted of trial and comprise error due whole to poor wayfinding boy i disliked copper that game ps room if you still insist on playing mec play with faith in the elevator there s usually a reflective black wall that can act as a mirror ho hum you will see how awful she is rendered barroom and for some reason you can see the back of her head when you turn quickly because apparently her eyes can turn around faster than her role head

0,i liked the n game so i was expecting some silly sci fi game with a diagram that didn t really make sensation or matter but the gameplay was just so drilling and insistent that i didn t feel wish this was even worth the this was on sale for on the rail shooters can be a dish out of play but the levels in this game and the foeman you fight are dull just view as the trigger and strafing is all it takings to move on except for some obnoxious controls during hirer the worst for me was that the game s co op was very weak commonly the game has one character you control on blind with the nunchuk while shooting with the wii remote control head at the blind but two player mode doesn t add a bit character it just lets another person flash at the blind there s no dodging or special attacks just view as the trigger and making it intemperate to see what s going on something positive is the gain of caption in multiple languages let in japanese but the dialogue is so hard to make out and silly that it doesn t really matter anyway when caption are the best part of the game it doesn t bode well for the rest of it

0,enchanted arms is an anime based turn based now that this is of the way let me briefly explain why i would not recommend this game anyone today in the game was released in the graphics are very outdated if you care about such details the intro movie very cool but when get into the gameplay itself the age really shows the area during battle mode is divided into a grid where d characters stand in their battle stance waiting for your order the interface is very similar to jrpg final fantasy phantasy star the animations very repetitive and do much variety in movement the effects for attack or defense and other weapons are ok lots of nice flashing shapes lights you can move the camera various positions plan out your attack or move very easily what is especially nice is the quick or mode one just does the choices for you avoids the steps that you move problems arise when you are in the movement mode or outside the battle let me give you an example there is a class of students and in this particular scene all the male students are one to one copies of one another and the as well it is annoying when you move you can barely any shadows anywhere the npcs do not show much life either if you were to similar characters talk to each other they have the with exception of haircuts or eye colors when you run around you like a robot run limited animations when you face an obstacle your character keeps repeating the the running motion english language overs are horrible the exception few characters i cannot tell bad or good the japanese voicing is another strange or annoying whatever you might call it is the voice acting and presentation one character who is suggested to be a crossdresser homosexual the issue i have with this is not that he is there but how he is presented if you were to imagine any gay stereotype its in the character think south park s big gay al there is a collar face makeup exposed stomach and girly gestures just me think why i would avoid this game at all there are many better jrpgs for xbox out there blue dragon is a alternative
